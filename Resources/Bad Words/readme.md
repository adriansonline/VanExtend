# Big List of Bad and Obscene Words

Within Vanilla Forums there is a plugin called "Civil Tongue" to remove or rather replace bad words in your forum. This one way to keep the language clean for communities targeting a young audience.

Keep in mind this list attempts to be as precise as possible to avoid safe words like a name like â€œDick" would not be listed, but dickhead, dickturd or shitdick would be removed.

It is released under GPL v2, for your use as you see fit. We welcome addition to the list. We also accept lists in your native language.
