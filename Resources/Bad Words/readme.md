# Big List of Bad and Obscene Words

Within Vanilla Forums there is a plugin called "Civil Tongue" to remove or rather replace bad (obscene) words in your forum. This is one way to keep the language clean for communities targeting a young audience.

This list is released under GPL v2, for your use as you see fit. We welcome addition or translations of equivalents in your native language.
