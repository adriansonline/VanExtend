#Amazing Analytics for Vanilla Forums#
Amazing Analytics provide extra data into your Google Analytics, and works only with UNIVERSAL ANALYTICS. It will add data on which Category are most viewed(as events). 
You will need to create two dimensions in your Google Analytics console. The first dimension will determine if a user is logged in vs not logged in. Scope type should be "session".
The second dimension, will advise you the highest RoleType of visitor. Scope type used should be "User". By default we take slots 1 and 2. If these slots are already taken
you will need to modify the code according to the proper dimensions to use.
