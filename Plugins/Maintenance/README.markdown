##Maintenance Plugin##
When you enable this plugin it will allow you to "close" your forum as you upgrade or make changes. You can customize closed.php to be whatever you want to be shown.

New Version Written From Scratch.

If you have any issues with redirect change line header to redirect to direct path ie: 'http://pathtovanilla/plugins/Maintenance/closed.php' ;

Now when in Maintenance mode, a bar will show to remind you to turn off the plugin. When you disbale the plugin, visitors can access the site again.

Note: Be careful not to sign out with plugin enabled or you have to go back and remove it from the plugins folder to get back in as admin. This is made for someone to upgrade or make small tweaks and reopen the forum.
