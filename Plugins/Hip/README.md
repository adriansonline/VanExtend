# Hide Admin IP

Some Admins may have a community where they want to hide their IP from other Admins or Mods and using a VPN takes too much work. This plugin will obfuscate the admin IP, for example when you post a comment or what appears on your profile.

Note: This will not change the IP you used when you initially registered your admin account. If you want to hide this, you should either use a VPN or go into the DB and change it to something else. 

** This will change what appears in Vanilla, but I will not guarantee 100% anonymity. **
