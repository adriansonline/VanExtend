# Hide Admin IP

Some Admins may have a community where they want to hide their IP from other Admins or Mods and using a VPN takes too much work. This plugin will generate a random "fake" IP for the admin when posting content and on profile.

Note: This will not change the IP you used when you initially registered your admin account. If you want to hide this, you should either use a VPN when you start using Vanilla or go into the DB and change it to something else. 

** This will change what appears in Vanilla, but I will not guarantee 100% anonymity. **
