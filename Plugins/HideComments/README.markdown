#Hide Comments#

Allows you to hide comments to non-members (or roles/permissions you set to be able to see the comments). It will still show the 1st discussion post universally.


**Requires Vanilla 2.1+


To Do - -Implement ideas from Lincoln:

<ul>
<li>Make a Vanilla.Comments.View permission per category that defaults to Vanilla.Discussions.View; and make the replacement string translatable</li>

<li> Add a setting that says "Users without permission to view comments may only see discussion excerpt" and implement that too</li>
</ul>
